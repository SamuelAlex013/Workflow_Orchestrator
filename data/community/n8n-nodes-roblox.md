# n8n-nodes-roblox

This project provides custom community nodes for [n8n](https://n8n.io) that integrate with the [Roblox Open Cloud API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud). It allows you to connect your Roblox experience with automated workflows in n8n — including data access, place publishing, messaging, and more.

## Features

- Community node package for n8n
- Built-in authentication with Open Cloud API keys
- Modular support for Roblox API endpoints
- Example nodes for querying and automating Roblox experiences

> ✅ Ideal for developers using Roblox + automation tools like n8n to build dashboards, pipelines, and custom tools.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher recommended)
- [n8n installed globally](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/)
  ```bash
  npm install -g n8n
  ```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LordMerc/roblox-n8n.git
