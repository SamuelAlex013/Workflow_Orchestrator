# HTTPS Over Proxy Node for n8n

> [ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàË™™ÊòéÊñá‰ª∂](README.zh-TW.md)

This node solves the critical limitation of n8n's built-in HTTP Request node: **the inability to connect to HTTPS websites when using an HTTP proxy**.

## The Problem

n8n's standard HTTP Request node fails when trying to access HTTPS sites through HTTP proxies, which is a common requirement in enterprise environments with firewall restrictions.

## The Solution

HTTPS Over Proxy node provides specialized proxy handling while maintaining compatibility with n8n's workflow ecosystem.

## Unique Features (Not Available in Built-in HTTP Request)

- **Connection Pool Management**: Specialized proxy connection pooling for optimal performance
- **Proxy Error Diagnostics**: Detailed proxy-specific error messages and troubleshooting guides

### üîß Enhanced Connection Management
- **Custom Connection Pools**: HTTP/HTTPS/Proxy agent management with configurable settings:
  - `maxSockets`: Maximum concurrent connections per host (default: 50)
  - `maxFreeSockets`: Maximum idle connections per host (default: 10)
  - `keepAlive`: Connection reuse optimization
  - `timeout`: Per-connection timeout control
- **Agent Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of unused connection agents

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Error Handling & Diagnostics
- **Proxy-Specific Error Messages**: Detailed error reporting for proxy connection issues
- **Troubleshooting Suggestions**: Built-in guidance for common proxy problems
- **Connection State Debugging**: Detailed logging of connection pool states
- **Smart Error Classification**: Distinguishes between proxy, network, and application errors

### üìä Enhanced Response Processing
- **HTML Content Extraction**: Advanced HTML parsing with CSS selectors
- **Mozilla Readability Integration**: Clean article extraction from web pages
- **JSDOM Processing**: Full DOM manipulation capabilities
- **Text Content Optimization**: Intelligent text extraction and formatting

### üîç Development & Debugging Features
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed request/response logging for debugging
- **cURL Command Parsing**: Advanced cURL import with proxy settings support
- **Request State Tracking**: Monitor connection states and performance metrics
- **Proxy Configuration Validation**: Automatic validation of proxy settings

## Installation

### Local Installation

1. Go to your n8n installation directory
2. Install the node package:
```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-httpsoverproxy
```

### Global Installation
