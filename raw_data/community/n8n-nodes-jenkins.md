# n8n-nodes-jenkins

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use **Jenkins** in your n8n workflows.

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that helps automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery. This node provides comprehensive integration with Jenkins REST API, allowing you to manage jobs, builds, and artifacts directly from your n8n workflows.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Operations

This Jenkins node supports two main resource types with various operations:

### Job Management
- **List All Jobs** - Retrieve a list of all jobs from your Jenkins instance
- **Get Job Details** - Get detailed information about a specific job
- **Create Job** - Create a new job using XML configuration
- **Update Job Config** - Update an existing job's configuration
- **Get Job Config** - Retrieve the XML configuration of a specific job
- **Trigger Job Build** - Start a parameterless build of a specific job
- **Trigger Job Build with Parameters** - Start a build with custom parameters
- **Delete Job** - Remove a specific job from Jenkins

### Build Management
- **Get Build** - Retrieve details of a specific build
- **Get Last Build** - Get information about the most recent build
- **Get Last Successful Build** - Retrieve details of the last successful build
- **Get Last Failed Build** - Get information about the last failed build
- **Stop Build** - Stop a running build
- **Get Build Console Output** - Retrieve the console output/logs of a build
- **List Build Artifacts** - Get a list of artifacts generated by a build
- **Get Build Artifact** - Download a specific artifact from a build

## Credentials

To use this node, you need to set up Jenkins API credentials. You'll need:

1. **Jenkins Base URL** - The URL of your Jenkins instance (e.g., `https://jenkins.example.com`)
2. **Username** - Your Jenkins username
3. **API Key** - Your Jenkins API token or password

### Setting up Jenkins API Access

1. **Generate an API Token** (Recommended):
   - Log into your Jenkins instance
   - Go to your user profile (top right corner)
   - Click on "Security"
   - In the "API Token" section, give your token a name and click "Add new Token"
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Alternative: Use Password**:
   - You can use your Jenkins password instead of an API token
   - Note: API tokens are more secure and recommended

3. **Configure the Credential in n8n**:
   - In n8n, go to Settings â†’ Credentials
   - Click "Add Credential"
   - Select "Jenkins Credentials API"
   - Enter your Jenkins Base URL, Username, and API Key/Password
   - Test the connection to ensure it works

## Compatibility

- **Node.js version**: >=20.15
- **Tested with**: n8n 1.100.1
