<div align="center">
<img src="./images/completed-config.png" alt="Completed node configuration" width="50%">
</div>


> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always use **server-side API keys** from Crossmint. Client-side keys will not work. For initial testing, always use **Staging** environment.

### Getting Test USDC for Staging

To test transactions in staging, you'll need test USDC tokens. You can get them from:

- **Circle Faucet**: [https://faucet.circle.com/](https://faucet.circle.com/) - Get free testnet USDC
- **Crossmint Telegram**: [https://t.me/crossmintdevs](https://t.me/crossmintdevs) - Request USDC from Crossmint

## üí° Supported Operations

The node is organized into two primary resources: **Wallet** and **Checkout**.

### Resource: Wallet
Operations for managing blockchain wallets which can hold and transfer money (in cryptocurrencies like USDC).

* **Get or Create Wallet**: Creates a non-custodial smart wallet or retrieves an existing one. You maintain full control via a private key that authorizes all transactions. This operation is idempotent.

## üîë Understanding Wallet Locators

Wallet locators are a key concept used throughout all Crossmint node operations. They provide a flexible way to identify and reference wallets using different types of identifiers.

### Locator Types

| Type | Format | Example | Use Case |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Wallet Address** | `1A1z...` | `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa` | Direct blockchain address reference |
| **Email** | `email:{email}:{chainType}:smart` | `email:user@example.com:solana:smart` | User identification by email |
| **User ID** | `userId:{id}:{chainType}:smart` | `userId:user-123:solana:smart` | Custom user identifier |
| **Phone Number** | `phoneNumber:{phone}:{chainType}:smart` | `phoneNumber:+1234567890:solana:smart` | SMS-based identification |
| **Twitter Handle** | `twitter:{handle}:{chainType}:smart` | `twitter:username:solana:smart` | Social media identification |
| **X Handle** | `x:{handle}:{chainType}:smart` | `x:username:solana:smart` | X (formerly Twitter) identification |


For more detailed information about wallet locator formats and specifications, see: [Crossmint Wallet Locators Documentation](https://docs.crossmint.com/api-reference/wallets/get-wallet-by-locator)

### Chain Types

- **Solana**: Solana blockchain

### Best Practices

1. **Email locators** are ideal for user-friendly identification
2. **Wallet addresses** provide direct blockchain access
3. **User ID locators** work well with existing user management systems
4. Always specify the correct chain type for non-address locators

## üîê Admin Signer Private Key

The **Admin Signer Private Key** is a critical security component that gives you full control over your Crossmint wallet. Understanding how it works is essential for secure wallet management.

### What is an Admin Signer?

The Admin Signer is the private key that acts as the "master key" for your smart wallet. It's used to:
- **Authorize all transactions** from the wallet
- **Sign transfer approvals** when moving tokens
- **Control wallet permissions** and operations

### Key Requirements by Blockchain

**For Solana:**
- Format: Base58 encoded string
- Example: `5Kb8kLf9CJtPkDCe4jfE9TjC8d7X9e3Jh4F6h8F2K3h7J9F4K6h8F2K3h7J9F4K6h`
- Typically 64 bytes when decoded

### Generating Private Keys

You can generate secure private keys using:
- **Crossmint Generator**: [https://www.val.town/x/Crossmint/crypto-address-generator](https://www.val.town/x/Crossmint/crypto-address-generator)
- **Phantom Wallet**: Export private key from an existing Solana wallet
- **Solana CLI**: Generate Solana keypairs
- **Hardware wallets**: Export or derive keys securely

### Security Best Practices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Guidelines:**

1. **Never share** your private key with anyone
2. **Store securely** - use environment variables or secure vaults
3. **Use different keys** for staging vs production
4. **Backup safely** - store in multiple secure locations
5. **Test first** - always test with small amounts on testnet
6. **Rotate regularly** - consider changing keys periodically

### How It Works in Crossmint

1. **Wallet Creation**: Your private key becomes the admin signer for the smart wallet
2. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Create transaction ‚Üí Crossmint generates approval request
   - Sign with private key ‚Üí Submit signature to complete transaction
3. **Non-Custodial**: You control the key, you control the wallet
