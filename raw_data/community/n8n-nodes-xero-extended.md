## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

**Note:** This node is currently only available for self-hosted n8n instances. It will be available for n8n Cloud users in the future via pull requests to the base Xero node.

## Operations

This node provides enhanced functionality for Xero integration, including additional resources and quality-of-life improvements that go beyond the standard Xero node.

### Available Operations

- **Contacts**: Get, Get Many, Create, Update, Delete
- **Invoices**: Get, Get Many, Create, Update, Delete
- **Organisations**: Get Connected Organisations, Get Organisation Details
- **Attachments**: Upload, Get, Get Many
- **Accounts**: Create, Get, Get Many, Update, Delete
- **Reports**: Get 1099 Report, Get Balance Sheet Report, Get Budget Summary Report, Get Profit and Loss Report
- **Bank Transactions**: Create, Get, Get Many
- **Bank Transfers**: Create, Get, Get Many
- **Manual Journals**: Create, Get, Get Many
- **History and Notes**: Create Note, Get History

Users can also benefit from the increased scopes to perform custom API calls with expanded actions.

## Credentials

This node uses Xero OAuth2 credentials that are separate from the standard Xero node. The credentials request additional scopes not included in the original Xero base node.

### Required Scopes

**Base scopes:**
- `offline_access`
- `accounting.transactions`
- `accounting.settings`
- `accounting.contacts`

**Additional scopes:**
- `accounting.attachments`
- `accounting.budgets.read`

### Setup

1. Create a new Xero OAuth2 credential (cannot use the base Xero node credentials)
2. Select the resource/organizations you want to work with or accept all

## Compatibility

This node is compatible with n8n versions that support community nodes. Tested with recent n8n versions.

## Installation

### For n8n Cloud users

This node is currently only available via installation on self-hosted instances. I will push to n8n-cloud via pull requests down the line to the base Xero node. However, so many changes and revisions have been done that the process would be time consuming for individual pull requests for the team to approve. I'll try to get to this some time in following month once I see about more additions.

### For self-hosted n8n users

To install a custom node in n8n, follow these steps:

- Refer to the official documentation: n8n Custom Node Installation (https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/)
- Choose the custom node you want to install, on the install community nodes box you'll enter the npm package name for the node. For example, n8n-nodes-xero-extended
- Once installed you will now need to setup the credentials for the node. See below for more info.


## Setup after installation

Similar to base Xero node:
1. Once installed you will set up the credentials in the same way done for the Xero base node. (you can't use the base Xero node as additional scopes are requested and needed for this node)
2. Select the resource/organisations you want to work with or accept all


## Credentials

This node uses a separate set of Xero OAuth2 credentials from the standard Xero node. The credentials created will also request additional scopes not in the original Xero base node. The scopes requested are as follows:

Previously the only scopes requested were: 	'offline_access', 'accounting.transactions', 'accounting.settings',	'accounting.contacts'

Now the following are requested in addition: 	'accounting.attachments',	'accounting.budgets.read',	'files',	'accounting.reports.read',
