# n8n-ikaue-nodes

Here you have an n8n* community node package developed by IKAUE that will help you with your BigQuery and Google Search Console data. What's different from previous n8n* nodes?


* With our BigQuery node, you can extract tables and run SQL customizable queries to get only the exact data you want.

* And with our Google Search Console node, you can also extract its data via API.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
