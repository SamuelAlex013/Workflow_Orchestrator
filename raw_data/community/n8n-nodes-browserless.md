#### New Updates: ðŸŽ‰ **Browserless** API V2 is now supported.

This is an n8n community node that allows you to interact with a [browserless](https://github.com/browserless/chrome) instance in your `n8n` workflows.

**Browserless** is a web service that enables remote clients to connect, drive, and execute headless tasks, all within Docker. It provides first-class integrations for Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium WebDriver, and several REST APIs for common tasks. Additionally, it addresses common issues like missing system fonts, external libraries, and performance improvements. It even handles tasks such as downloading files, managing sessions, and includes a fully-featured documentation site.

If youâ€™ve struggled with setting up Chrome in Docker or scaling headless workloads, browserless is designed for you.

If youâ€™ve been trying to automate browser-related tasks like `web scraping`, `browser automation`, `end-to-end testing`, or `PDF generation` with `n8n` and want to avoid dealing with browser infrastructure, the `n8n-nodes-browserless` will make your life easier.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
