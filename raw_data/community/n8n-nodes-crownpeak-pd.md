# n8n-nodes-crownpeak-pd

## Overview

This repository provides a custom n8n integration node for the [Fredhopper Product Discovery API](https://crownpeak.gitbook.io/product-discovery). It enables direct access to product discovery operations such as authentication, item management, catalog, category tree, and locale configuration within an n8n workflow.

## What is it?

An n8n node module designed to simplify integration with Crownpeak Fredhopper Product Discovery's API using secure credential management. It supports:

- Secure authentication using username/password and OAuth2 token endpoint
- Manage product items: create, update, delete, and upsert
- Manage item schemas and catalogs
- Manage category trees and locale settings
- Chain operations using dynamic expressions for automated product data pipelines

## What is it for?

This module is useful for organizations looking to build automated product onboarding, enrichment, and publishing pipelines into the Crownpeak Fredhopper ecosystem.
