## Development

### Release Flow

After merging PRs into master, follow these steps to publish a new version:

```bash
# Switch to master branch and ensure it's up to date
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Bump version (patch, minor, or major)
npm version patch         # or minor / major

# Push changes and tags
git push origin master
git push origin v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
```

The tag push will automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will:
1. Build the package
2. Check if the version already exists on npm
3. Publish to npm if it's a new version

You'll see a âœ… job in the Actions tab and the new version will appear on npm within a minute.
