![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Version Notice

**This version has been implemented without the aqbanking-cli tool dependency and is intended for testing purposes only.** This is a development version primarily designed for developers working on German banking integrations and should not be used in production environments. It is specifically designed for German banking institutions only.

**Please do not install this version for production use. It is meant for testing and development purposes only.**

## Installation

**Important Note**: This development version has been implemented without the `aqbanking-tools` dependency using direct FinTS/HBCI protocol implementation. This version is for testing and development purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

For users on n8n v0.187+, your instance owner can install this node from **Community Nodes**.

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-aqbanking` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n runs `npm install` in the background.

### Manual installation

To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-aqbanking
```

For Docker-based deployments, you need to ensure `aqbanking-tools` is installed within your container. You can do this by creating a custom Dockerfile based on the official n8n image:

**Dockerfile Example:**
```dockerfile
# Use the official n8n image as a base
FROM n8nio/n8n:latest

# Switch to root user to install system packages
USER root

# Install AqBanking tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y aqbanking-tools && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the community node
RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-aqbanking

# Switch back to the node user
USER node
```

Build and run this custom image instead of the standard one.

### Manual installation

To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-aqbanking
```

## Security Notes

- Your banking credentials are securely stored in n8n's credential system
- The PIN is encrypted and never logged
- All communication with AqBanking happens locally on your system
- No banking data is transmitted to external services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"aqbanking-cli command not found"**
- Make sure AqBanking is installed on your system
- Verify `aqbanking-cli` is in your system PATH

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check your User ID and PIN
- Ensure your AqBanking setup is complete and working
- Test with `aqbanking-cli request --balance` first

**"Could not parse balance"**
